I have been trained on Devops here, I would suggest it as i found it to be very nice place for learning balancing the job. Training's are  friendly, even though i work in shifts institute has provided me flexible timings to attend classes. More over best part is it is not a training center with  mass batches. Trainer was more patient in teaching. Assignments, Practice sessions, Labs everything added more value to class. I would thank institute and my trainer for value added course.
